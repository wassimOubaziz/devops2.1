To deploy your application:

First, create these Jenkins credentials:
aws-access-key: Your AWS access key
aws-secret-key: Your AWS secret key
aws-token-key: Your AWS session token
db-username: Database username
db-password: Database password
Run the pipeline in two steps:
Code
CopyInsert
# Step 1: Create infrastructure
Run pipeline with:
- TERRAFORM_ACTION = apply
- Other parameters can be left as default

# Step 2: Deploy application
Run pipeline with:
- TERRAFORM_ACTION = none
- SERVICE = all
The pipeline will:

Create all AWS infrastructure (VPC, EKS, RDS)
Build and push Docker images
Deploy all services to Kubernetes
Verify the deployment and database connection
Output the frontend LoadBalancer URL
Would you like me to make any adjustments to this setup?

Me

how can i do this 
# Step 1: Create infrastructure
Run pipeline with:
- TERRAFORM_ACTION = apply
- Other parameters can be left as default

# Step 2: Deploy application
Run pipeline with:
- TERRAFORM_ACTION = none
- SERVICE = all

I'll guide you through running the pipeline in Jenkins step by step:

Step 1: Create Infrastructure

Go to your Jenkins dashboard
Click on your pipeline project
Click "Build with Parameters"
Set the parameters as follows:
SERVICE: select all
AWS_ACCOUNT_ID: leave as default (or set to your AWS account ID)
AWS_REGION: leave as default (or set to your preferred region)
VERSION: leave as latest
CLUSTER_NAME: leave as main-cluster
TERRAFORM_ACTION: select apply
Let me create a script to help you run this from the command line:

Created
deploy_infra.sh
+25
-0
 0
Open diff
Created
deploy_app.sh
+25
-0
 0
Open diff
Here's how to run the deployment:

Through Jenkins UI:
Step 1: Create Infrastructure

Go to Jenkins dashboard
Navigate to your pipeline
Click "Build with Parameters"
Set:
Code
CopyInsert
TERRAFORM_ACTION = apply
SERVICE = all
Click "Build"
Wait for the infrastructure creation to complete (check the console output)
Step 2: Deploy Application

Once Step 1 is complete, go back to your pipeline
Click "Build with Parameters" again
Set:
Code
CopyInsert
TERRAFORM_ACTION = none
SERVICE = all
Click "Build"
Through Command Line:
Edit the scripts I created with your Jenkins details:
Open deploy_infra.sh and deploy_app.sh
Replace:
your-jenkins-url:8080 with your Jenkins URL
your-pipeline-name with your pipeline name
your-jenkins-token with your Jenkins API token
your-username with your Jenkins username
Run the scripts:
Code
CopyInsert
# First, make the scripts executable
chmod +x deploy_infra.sh deploy_app.sh

# Step 1: Create infrastructure
./deploy_infra.sh

# Wait for infrastructure creation to complete (check Jenkins UI)

# Step 2: Deploy application
./deploy_app.sh
Important Notes:

Make sure to wait for Step 1 (infrastructure creation) to complete successfully before starting Step 2
You can monitor the progress in Jenkins:
Green status means success
Red status means failure
Blue status means in progress
Check the console output for each build to see detailed progress and any potential errors
To get your Jenkins API token:

Go to Jenkins dashboard
Click your username â†’ Configure
Click "Add new Token"
Give it a name and generate
Copy the token (you won't be able to see it again)
